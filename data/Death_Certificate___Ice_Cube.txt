say, look at this
ive been cleaning out my nest, and i found an old book of my poetry




fresh out of school cause i was a high school grad
gots to get a job cause i was a high school dad
wish i got paid by rappin to the nation
but thats not likely, so heres my application
pass it to the man at at&t
cause when i was in school i got the aee
but theres no sc for this youngsta
i didnt have no money, so now i gotta punch the
clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
but whitey says theres no room for the african
always knew that i would clock gs
but welcome to mcdonalds, "may i take your order, please?"
gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
cause my son doesnt take no for an answer
now i pay taxes, that you never give me back
what about diapers, bottles, and similac?
do i have to sell me a whole lotta crack
for decent shelter and clothes on my back?
or should i just wait for help from bush?
or jesse jackson, and operation push?
if you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
a massengill, what the hell
crack will sell in the neighborhood
to the corner house bitches
miss parker, little joe, and todd bridges
or anybody that he know
so i copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
now everybody know i went from po
to a fella that got dough
so now you put the feds against me
cause i couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
i never get love again
but blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican
now i remember, i used to be cool
til i stopped fillin out my w2
now senators are gettin high
and your plan against the ghetto backfired
so now you got a pep talk
but sorry, this is our only room to walk
cause we dont want a drug push
but a bird in the hand is worth more than a bush




tell the politicians, the hustlers
live and let live (yeah)
tell the politicians, the hustlers

(i can dig it)
(dog catcher, dog catcher)
(i can dig it)
(dog catcher, dog catcher)
(i can dig it)




heres another topic im addressin
so learn a quick lesson, about your smith and wesson
sit your ass back and comprehend
as i let you know about mans best friend
now remember, it used to be a dog like lassie
but now in 91, its a gun if you asked me
just like a jimmy hats used for protection
i use my nine when suckers start to flexin
cause if you run up and try to play mine
id rather have a ak than a fucking canine
cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetcha
me and the dogs goin out on a stretcher
and i aint with that, so i gotta get that
big black gat, aim and i hit that
forget about a dog, fool, hell shit in the den
nowadays, a gat is mans best friend




(dog catcher, dog catcher)
(i can dig it) mans best friend
(dog catcher, dog catcher)
(i can dig it)






here is the reason why ice cube pack
just in case the little punks try to jack
i cant put a motherfucking pitbull
under a coat in the small of my back
so i gotta take my beretta, and i betcha
itll probably work a hundred percent better
cause itll keep me out of danger
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
so this goes to all yall intruders
beware of the owner cause the owner is a shooter
i dont just wanna give your ass rabies
id rather have your ass pushing up daisies
and i cant do that with benji
rin tin tin, or spuds mckenzie
forget about a dog, fool, hell shit in the den
nowadays, a gat is mans best friend




("just dont let me see you shoot no dogs")
("hey, i got shots fired here, send me another unit")
("the profile of a typical american gun owner is this:
over thirty, white, male, middle class")


"take that, motherfuckers"




1234567890987654321




down at the best spot
its me and jdee and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
the spots hot, and everybody nervous
thats when the blue car surfaced
oh, why did fools have to let loose?
heard six pops from a deucedeuce
big tom had to push us
thirteen fellas runnin straight to the bushes
for they gats so they can draw down
but why a motherfucker like me have to fall down?
not knowin why i dropped out
fuck it, still cant afford to get popped out
so now i gotta jet
only ran one block, but my shirt is soakin wet
tryna see if we got em
looked down and my sweatshirts red at the bottom
didnt panic but i still looked cracked out
yelled to the homies then i blacked out




get up, man, get up, man (come on, keep that fella awake, man)
come on, man, get up, man, come on, man




woke up in the back of a trey
on my way to mlk
thats the county hospital, jack, ha
where fellas die over a little scratch
sittin in the trauma center
in my back is where the bullet entered
"yo, nurse, im gettin kinda warm"
bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
coughin up blood on my hands and knees
then i heard, "freeze, fella, dont move"
yo, i didnt do a thing
dont wanna go out like my man rodney king
still got gaffled
internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
now im handcuffed
being asked information on my gang affiliation
"i dont bang, i rock the good rhymes
and im a victim of neighborhood crime"




are you the only one who got shot?
what kind of a gun was he carrying? do you know who it was?
(no, man, dont know who it was, man)
are you in a gang?
(man, what does it matter, man? im shot)




i need to see a md
and yall motherfuckers giving me the third degree?
look at the waiting room
its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
nobody gettin help
since we poor, the hospital, it moves slow
now im laid out
people steppin over me to get closer to the tv
just like a piece of dog shit
now will i die on this nappy ass carpet?
one hour done passed
done watched two episodes of m*a*s*h
and when im almost through
they call my name and put me in icu
halfway dead
no respect, and handcuffed to the bed
now the drama starts
cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
then i begin the ass kissin
just to get looked at by a overworked physician
had the chills, but my temperatures a hundred and three
only got a bandaid and a iv
thats when i start cussin
police steady askin me who did the bustin






what did you get shot with? (twentytwo)
who shot you? (i dunno who shot me)
was it gangbangers? (had to be)




why, oh why, cant i get help?
cause im black, i gots to go for self
too many black bodies the hospital housin
so at 10 pm, i was audi 5000




1234567890987654321




let me live my life
we can no longer live our lives
then let us give our lives for the liberation
and salvation of the black nation
saints, saviors, soldiers, scholars, healers and killers
no longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our mind
brainwashed with the white mans mind
no more homicide
no more fratricide
no more suicide, infanticide and genocide
look the goddamn white man in his cold blue eyes
devil dont even try, we bebes kids
we dont die, we multiply
you heard the death side
now open your black eyes for the rebirth, resurrection and rise

the father and mother of all the nation of religion, philosophy, art, science and civilization
no further
all they can say about the black man
is he was, he is, and he shall be
before him there were none
and after him, there will be no more
before we can make a way for the peace maker
we must kill, and get rid of the peace breaker

it seems like he got the whole country behind him
so its sort of hard to find him
but when i do, gotta put my gat in his mouth

cause the shit he did was uncalled for
tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore

mama, some man at the front door (sit your ass down)
uh, hi
i have reason to believe that someone in this household has just turned eighteen
am i correct?


heres why i wanna kill the punk
cause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk
he came to my house, i let em bail in
cause he said he was down with the lm
he gave up a little dap
then turned around and pulled out a gat
i knew it was a caper
i said, "please dont kill my mother," so he raped her
tied me up, took me outside
and i was thrown in a big truck
and it was packed like sardines
full of fellas who fell for the same scheme
took us to a place and made us work
all day and we couldnt have shit to say
broke up the families forever
and to this day, black folks cant stick together
and its odd
broke us down, made us pray to his god
and when i think about it, it make me say "damn
i wanna kill sam"




ah, ahahah, ahah (im comin)

its the fella you love to hate with a new song
so what really goes on?
nothing but a comeup, but aint that a bitch?
they hate to see a young fella rich
but i refuse to switch even though
cause i cant move to the snow
cause soon as yall get some dough
you wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
moving out your neighborhood
but i walk through the ghetto and the flavors good
little kids jumping on me
but you, you wanna be white and corny
living way out
"fella, go home" spraypainted on your house
trying to be white or a jew
but ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
get the hell out
stop being an uncle tom, you little sellout
house fella scum

yeah, motherfucker
yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?
yeah, get a little money and moved out the neighborhood and shit
but you still aint shit




when you first start rhyming
it started off slow and then you start climbing
but it wasnt fast enough, i guess
so you gave your other style a test
you was hardcore hiphop
now look at yourself, boy, you done flipflopped
giving our music away to the mainstream
dont you know they aint down with the team?
they just sent they boss over
put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
on mtv, but they dont care
theyll have a new fella next year
youre out in the cold
no more white fans and no more soul
and you might have a heart attack
when you find out the black folks dont want you back
and you know whats worse?
you was just like the fella in the first verse
stop sellin out your race
and wipe that stupidass smile off your face
fellas always gotta show they teeth
now ima be brief, be true to the game






yeah, motherfucker, i see you got your fancy cars and shit
but you know what? you still aint shit
thats right, i caught you slipping
you know i couldve gat you, yeah, but i didnt even trip




a message to the oreo cookie
find a mirror and take a look, g
do you like what you see?
but youre quick to point the finger at me
you wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
black man cant be no yuppie
you put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
you dont associate with the negroes
you wanna be just like jack
but jack is calling you a fella behind your back
so back off, genius
i dont need you to correct my broken english
you know thats right
you aint white
so stop holding your ass tight
cause you cant pass
so why you keep trying to pass?
with your black ass
mister big
but in reality, youre shorter than a midge
you only got yourself to blame
get a grip, oreo, and be true to the game




uh, yeah
uh, yeah
haha
and ice cube practices what he preaches
he continues to live in south central los angeles and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood
be true to the game




12345678900987654321




heres another day at the stoplight
im lookin in my mirror so i can see who can see me
south central is puttin ice cube to the test
with four brothers in the ss
now i cant go around and cant back up
so i gotta peep game layin in the cut
is this a jack or a kidnap?
since im never ever slippin, im fully strapped
i grab my gat out the glove
do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
and when the light turn green, i dont bone out
i wanna see what these black men are all about
cause if its my time, im just short
if not, im pluggin they super sport
first they get behind my ride
then they switch lanes to the left side
im scopin out the one smokin indo
comin up fast, rollin down his window
he threw up a sign, i put away my nine
fool, cause im colorblind




killer cali, the state where they kill
over colors cause brothers dont know the deal
and theyll cap you, not if they have to
but if they want to, first they might confront you
but every fella on my block cant stop
and he wont stop and he dont stop
not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
and rookies aint the only ones that drop
some say the little locs is gettin a little too loc
and when it come to dust, they kick up the most
say the wrong words
then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
bust a uturn, come back and get served, fella
for the women, it dont matter how loud they blouse get
for men, the wrong color outfit can get your mouth split
its a shame, but it aint no thing to me
cause i sling these things like a g
its on, its anybody killer for the summertime
i gotta get another nine even though im colorblind






im fresh out the county on bail
and no sooner do i get out, seems like im right back in jail
for some gang related activity
cause every day, different fools try to get with me
for no more than a color or territory
cant rehabilitate em, thats the sheriffs story
so whats left?
the judge goes deaf
when you try to tell your side
and you aint blueeyed
boy, you better duck cause the book is comin
so just hand your car keys over to your woman
because it aint no sunshine where you headed
and this shitll drive you crazy if you let it
but now i got time to think
because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
and i aint even shed a tear
cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
now picture that
but on a black and white photograph
cause brothers, you dont know the half
on the streets, i was damn near out of my mind
but ever since ive been down, im colorblind




now heres the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
i was told to peel a cap on the other side
yo, young and dumb and full of cum, i’m a baby loc
i gotta put in work for the hood and that aint no joke
stable and able, but im not ready and willin
cause im only thirteen and i aint never did a killin
grabbed the ak and jumped in the g ride
started up the bucket and headed for the other side
yo, spotted the enemies, now im on a creep tip
hit the five dollar stick and i put in my clip
so i jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
i had my mind set on sendin fellas to harrison ross
caught one from the back and i looked in his eyes
thinkin, "should i peel his cap, or should i let him survive?"
yo, im trapped in the plan designed by the other kind
i aint contributin to genocide
why?
this suckers colorblind




fellas in the hood aint changed
and ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
cause i walk the alleys of compton with nowhere to turn
every which way, i get burned
baby boo wears blue, big fred wears red
put em together, then we color em dead
dead, dying, gettin smokeds like part of the fun
they get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral




i understand how all my homeboys feel
cause ive been shot and to this day i pack my steel
cause i was born in a certain territory
where you dont talk, only the streets tell stories
where blue and red bandanas on the street
and if youre slippin, youll be six feet deep
see, me and tbone, we pay it no mind
and for the rest of the mob, we stay colorblind




i thought i could get into caring, but if i started caring, then i would get sloppy




1234567890987654321




oshea, oshea
get your ass in here, boy
you hear me calling you?
oshea




when i was young i used to hang with the seventh graders
little bad motherfucker playing space invaders
fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
working with the schoolhouse bully
by doing that, i had a lot of pull, g
cheating on tests, making a mess
cussing like a sailor at recess
it mustve been a halfmoon
cause youll catch me running out the little girls bathroom
chewing on good and plenties
got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
yo, i was living like the class clown
pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes, man
when you young its hard to see
that its wrong throwing rocks at the rtd
popping out your window with a bb gun
better yet knocking on your door and run
playing hideandgogetit for a little stank
even though i was still shooting blanks
as soon as the dark hit
i was stealing candy out the corner market
until i got my ass whipped
cause i was ten years old, doing dumb shit






thirteen, thats how old i was
when my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
and i was looking at any butt and ass
me and my homies started cutting class
going up to the high school
looking for any bitch i could lie to
tell em i was older than i really was
smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
thats what a macks made of
but when i got my first piece of pussy i fell in love
hard as a rock the long way
and then i put the rubber on the wrong way
but i still gotta have it
overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
goddamn, i was hype
a virgin but i still knew how to lay the pipe
even though the ho worked me
i still knocked the boots from here to albuquerque
then the shit got strange, money
i started shaking and jimmy felt funny
then the nut came gushing
i jumped up got dressed and start pushing
cause i thought the bitch broke my dick
cause i was still young doing dumb shit




at seventeen got my first volkswagen
and mastered the lifelong art of dragging
to the women in college
hung out with the ogs and got some street knowledge
breaking in cars and all that
hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
fucking at a real fast rate
til they said that i might not graduate
then i said, "fuck the dumb shit
cause popsll fuck me up quick
if things continue"
so i start rapping about shit i been through
and i got real good
now i look at all the kids in the neighborhood
tryna be baby macks
doing shit that i did seven years back
going through a stage
but before they can grow up they on the front page
and they moms is having a fit
cause they died young, doing dumb shit


1234567890987654321

exploitin us like the caucasians did (yup)
for 400 years, i got 400 tears, for 400 peers
died last year from gangrelated crimes
thats why i got gangrelated rhymes (right)
but when i do a show to kick some facts
us blacks dont know how to act
sometimes i believe the hype, man
we mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
but dont point the finger you jiggaboo
take a look at yourself, ya dumb fella, you

1234567890987654321




and now, the wonderous world of
hey, come to los angeles!
where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
enjoy the refinement
hey bone, hey fella where you at though?
hello, my name is elaine
and ill be your tour guide through south central los angeles




how to survive in south central (what you do?)
a place where bustin a cap is fundamental
no, you cant find the shit in a handbook
take a close look, at a rap crook
rule number one: get yourself a gun
a 9 and your assll be fine
keep it in your glove compartment
cause jackers (yo), they love to start shit
now if youre white you can trust the police
but if youre black, they aint nothin but beasts
watch out for the kill
dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
and dont get smart
answer all questions, and thats your first lesson
on stayin alive
in south central, yeah, thats how you survive






hi, this is elaine again
are you enjoying your stay in south central los angeles?
or has somebody taken your things?
have you witnessed a driveby?
okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
so you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
this is los angeles, this is los angeles




rule number two: dont trust nobody
especially a bitch with a hookers body
cause it aint nothin but a trap
and femalesll get you jacked and kidnapped
youll wind up dead
just to be safe dont wear no blue or red
cause most fellas get got
in either la, compton or watts
pissed off black human beings
so i think you better skip the sightseeing
and if youre nothin but a mark
make sure that youre in before dark
but if you need some affection, mate
make sure the bitch aint a section 8
cause if so thats a monkeywrench ho
and you wont survive in south central






now you realize its not all that its cracked up to be
you realize that its fucked up!
it aint nothin like the shit you saw on tv
palm trees and blonde bitches?
id advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
and youll get your ass straight smoked
yo, i wanna say whats up to dj chilly chill, sir jinx
ayo cube, these motherfuckers dont know what time it is
so show these motherfuckers whats happenin
tell these motherfuckers, dont fuck around in south central
goddammit!




rule number three: dont get caught up
cause fellas are doing anything thats thought up
and they got a price
on everything from dope to stolen merchandise
weed to sherm
cause south central la is one big germ
waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin kis
to an undercover or the wrong brother
and theyll smother, a out of town motherfucker
so dont take your life for granted
cause its the craziest place on the planet
in la, heroes dont fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
so everybodys doin a little dirt
and its the youngsters puttin in the most work
so be alert and stay calm
