watch how they actin, when they rеlease the krakеn
you know, save everything but a fox
yo momma wont let go off the jiggalo
she call me a marvel, you a dc comic
yup, straightup retardo
i started off with too much cargo
dropped the avengers, picked up my ninjas
knocked the door off the hinges
fuck the cowboys, down with the indians
blacker than a panther
if this was wakanda, ill spit the anthem
i only got a villain as a friend
you know his name bitch, mc ren, lets go




if you lookin at your man, and he look like a scarecrow

your homeboys hate you, imma violate you
give you that motherfucking broken bottle facial
this ain’t racial, your new name is rachel
got fellas in the pen, that might wanna date you
i underrate you, then annihilate you, like that fuckin therapist that said i had a breakthrough
this is what i live for, this is called survival
all my rivals are dead on arrival




this is a revival, better bring your bible
these lyrics are something, you might wanna die for
im not libel, fella i’m the dope
nope, thats a typo, fella im the pope
west coast cycle, on a motorcycle
dressed like michael, it aint halloween
my city is so mean, im idi amin
im the bakers man, got the cake, got the cream
the undertaker man, from laygaland
the world is my toy, like legoland
the old man in the van looking for his puppy
do you wanna help me, you tinder young guppie?
the big fish gotta eat, dont interrupt me
the ones who got away, are oh so lucky
the only thing found most of the time is a huffy
you pretty young thing, it’s about to get ugly






see, my pen is mightier than my ak
and my enemies wont have a good day
see, my pen is mightier than my ak
and my enemies wont have a good day




blow they ass away
put em on layaway
fuck their whole world up with the shit i say
fuck their whole life up with the shit i write
its a shark in the water, do you feel the bite?




see, my pen is mightier than my ak
and my enemies wont have a good day
see, my pen is mightier than my ak
and my enemies wont have a good day
