Niggas are in the state of emergency
The Death Side, a mirrored image of where we are today
The Life Side, a vision of where we need to go
So sign your death certificate
(A message to the world)
(I heard—, wait a minute)
Fuck all y'all




Lisa got him
Alright, on three, one, two, three
Get all folks together, this way
Can't believe it, though
Tom, yo
Hey, open that door
Open that one first
Alright, alright
We've come together by God's demand
Whether it be for life or death
Well, this morning
It's over the mourning of one of our little brothers
This brother was a good brother
He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble
But it's one thing, it's one thing, it's one thing
He was the wrong nigga to fuck with


1234567890987654321






Goddamn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay?
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack Swing on my nuts
Down wit' the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum, bitch, and I didn't have to sell out
"Fuck you, Ice Cube", that's what the people say
Fuck America, still with the triple K
'Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from twelve stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit' duck quick
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
("I'ma let y'all know one thing man")




Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin' L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
'Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin' fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and croaker sacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Muthafuckin' crew, muthafuckin' mob
Do a muthafuckin' job in a muthafuckin' squad
In '91, Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
("One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and")
("Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute")
Drop a old school beat




Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out)
True motherfuckin' baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass 'til I'm smellin' shit
Off with the head, off with the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken
Grand Dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over with a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with


("Last person in the world you wanna fuck with")
("Last person in the world you wanna fuck with")
("Last person in the world you wanna fuck with")




1234567890987654321




This is the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angeles
On destination to St. Louis, thank you




Damn, G, the spot's gettin' hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggas through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they mama sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, 'cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
'Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady
But they can't fade South Central
'Cause bustin' a cap is fundamental
Peepin' out every block close
Seein' which one will clock the most
Yeah, this is the one, no doubt
Bust a U, Bone, and let's clear these niggas out


Ayy, ayy, man, wassup, nigga?
Yo, well, this Lench Mob, nigga




Now clearin' 'em out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and outta there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know? A drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took they corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble
'Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Gettin' bitches and they can't stand a
1991 Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin' up dust
And some of them are even lookin' up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin' that gang fuss
Givin' up much love
Dyin' for a street that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers wanna stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on






At the top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings
Have migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured
No arrests have been made
Police say this is a nationwide trend
With similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma




Boom, my homie got shot, he's a goner, black
St. Louis niggas want they corner back
Shootin' in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together
Fuckin' police got the 4-1-1
That L.A. ain't all surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin' 'bout the boys
Feudin' like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin' tricky
'Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle
But the NARCs raid about six in the mornin'
Try to catch a nigga when he's yawnin'
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers
Tryna give me fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin'
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and the Bloods by hand, G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if any one of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
'Cause look at the motherfuckin' years that I'm facin'
I'ma end it like this 'cause you know what's up
My life is fucked






Come on, G
Police, eat a dick, straight up
Look here, you lil' goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin' nobody
You fuckin' understand me? (Kick his ass, put him down)
That's right, get down on the goddamn ground now
Fuckin' move, now (Let me take a shot at him, let me take a shot him)
We're gonna do you like King
What goddamn King?
Rodney King, Martin Luther King, and all the goddamn Kings from Africa
Look out, motherfucker




1234567890987654321


God damn
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known to break em' off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood




Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With "U Can't Touch This" on the front
I'm out to get rich
'Cause life ain't nothin' but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama, hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'




Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood




Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
'Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck PacTel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Don't drink 8-Ball 'cause St. Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin' in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out 'cause I just don't trust 'em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'




Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood






Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, "What up, loc?"
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke? Get in, nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps
For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said, "Pappy, could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?"
I said, "Yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex"
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'






Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood




There goes the neighborhood
Get the radio, get the radio
There goes the neighborhood

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Robin Lench
And welcome to the "Lifestyles of the Poor and Unfortunate" (Man, fuck you)
Where you and your broad can win eight days and nine dangerous nights
At The Come On In Motel overviewing the Watts Tower
And for your transportation pleasures, you get to ride on what?
The "R.T.D.", the "Rough, Tough and Dangerous"
Where we provide you and your bitch round trip transfer
Straight down range (Ayo, nigga, get outta the car, nigga)
Where you get to meet, who? O.G. MudBone (Man, who the fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Hello, O.G. MudBone, say hi (Nigga, fuck you, motherfucker, get outta here)
(Win these nuts, punk)
And for your gambling cravings
You can lose that trick-bitch that's with ya, almost, well
Basically anywhere (I'll give you twenty dollars for your bitch)
And for your nightlife entertainment, you get to visit
Our very own strawberry showgirls
Located where? On Figueroa (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, bitch, ayy, how much for head?
Until next time
Forty ounce dreams and watermelon wishes
I'm Robin Lench, peace
5000 G




1234567890987654321




Yeah?




Um, uh, is Cheryl here?


Well, who are you?




Tell her Ice Cube is here




Who?




Ice Cube




Ice Cube?
Man, I ain't letting my damn daughter go out with no damn Ice Cubes
Man, what the hell you talkin' about, man?
I brought my daughter up, man, in a Catholic school, private school
Man, what you want with her?
I'm sick of this bullshit
Yo, man, let me tell you something


Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut
A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut
Gobbling up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird
Sucking up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third
Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class
Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass
Only seventeen with a lot of practice
On black boys' jimmies and white boys' cactus
Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic
That don't mean shit 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick
Quicker than you can say "candy"
The bitch is on my Snicker
And oh man, she can take on three men built like He-Men
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride and joy, I mean daddy's little angel
Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house
'Cause your daughter's known for givin' up the nappy dug out




I got a big old ding-a-ling
And if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out
I got a big old ding-a-ling
And if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out






Look, motherfucker, you better get from in front of my house with that old goddamn bullshit
You curly-haired motherfucker
You better get out of here witcho' lyin' ass
Man, youse a little lyin' motherfucker




Mister, mister, before you make me go
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a ho
Nympho, nympho, boy, is she bad
Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads
I know she is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio
And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her
Boots get knocked from here to Czechoslovakia
Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him
'Cause after I got 'em it was over
Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover
On daddy's little girl
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel
So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home
'Cause the line at my house is getting long, and






I got a big old ding-a-ling
And if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out
I got a big old ding-a-ling (Yo)
And if that bitch can hang (Yo)
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out
I got a big old ding-a-ling (Yeah)
And if that bitch can hang (Yeah)
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out
I got a big old ding-a-ling
And if that bitch can hang (Yo)
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter


Little motherfucker




Daddy, where did he go?




I'll tell you where he went, goddammit
(Mercy)


[Bridge]
Givin' up the nappy, givin' up the nappy dug out
Givin' up the nappy, givin' up the nappy dug out (Mercy)
Givin' up the nappy dug out
Givin' up the nappy dug out (Mercy)
Givin' up the nappy, givin' up the nappy dug out
Givin' up the nappy, givin' up the nappy dug out (Mercy)
Givin' up the nappy dug out
Givin-givin' up the nappy dug out
(Mercy)




Warning, when having sexual intercourse with a female like Cheryl
You must use jimmy hat condoms
We're called jimmy hats, have you ever seen us?
Most guys wear us 'round rolled up on your penis
If you're real smart, you will always use us
Put me in your wallet, or some dummy screws us
And going bareback without the bare facts
And have creepy crawlies crawling on your nutsack
So get the J-I-M-M-Y to the hats
It's me and two brothers in a pack
Run out and get your jimmy hats
Small and extra large
Run out and get your jimmy hats
Or this might happen to you




1234567890987654321




What you doin' up here anyway nigga?
Man I came up to get some rubbers man, what you doin up here?
No shit? Man, I came up here to get a physical
You know for my job, you gotta get a physical and shit, but (Really?)
Philip Brown to the front desk, Philip Brown
Aw that's me right there, hey man, you stay up, man
Philip Brown
Be careful and shit you know
Alright then homie
Philip Brown?
Yeah?
Can I help you?
Ahh, ah-uh-yeah, I'd like to get—
I'd like to get a physical
We don't give physicals here
Oh you don't?
No, all we test for is VD, herpes, syphilis and gonorrhea
I'd like to see a doctor
What's the matter, you burning?
Huh?




Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
Why is my thing-thing burnin like this?
You burning?
Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
What have I, done stuck my dick in?




I went to the free clinic, it was filled to capacity
Now how bad can a piece of ass be?
Very bad, so I had to make the trip
And thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a ho couldn't gimme that
Just to get twenty free jimmy hats
Now look who I see
Ain't that—yeah, that's the bitch from up the street
With the big fat tail
Who always told Cube to go to hell
She thought she was wiser
Now she's sittin' in the waitin' room, burnin' like Heat Miser
Yeah, I see ya
First Miss Thang, now Miss Gonorrhea
Man, it's a trip how the world keeps turnin'
It's 1991, and look who's burnin'




Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
What have I, done stuck my dick in?






Now everybody is a victim, you can go see 'em
And you'll hear more claps than the Coliseum
Sittin' there all quiet and embarrassed
Up, there go that bitch who was careless
I remember she wouldn't give the cock
To anybody who lived on the block
Now ho, look what you got
Bend that big ass over for the shot
'Cause somebody is pipin' hot
Drippin' like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
And he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
With some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin'
But ask for some water bitch, and look who's burnin'




Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
Why is my thing-thing burnin' like this?
Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
Why is my thing-thing burnin' like this?




It burns
Fitfully, sputteringly to it's end (Aw, shit)
At which there is, a little surprise
That stupid ass bitch




Yo, it ain't my fault you got the heebie-jibbies
But you still try to act like you didn't see me
So I walk over, and say "Hi
Bitch, don't try to act surprised"
You shoulda put a sock on the pickle
And your pussy wouldn't be blowin' smoke signals
Man, this is gonna kill 'em
Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, "Who?", and I tell 'em you
The new leader of the big booty crew
And after today, I'm sorry to say
You come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away
To a nigga, who's out to get major paid
But you'll have him, pissin' out razorblades
But a bitch like you'll be returnin' with the HIV, RIP




You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
What have I, done stuck my dick in?




Done stuck my dick in?
I'm burning up
It's hot, I'm burning up




1234567890987654321




Say, look at this
I've been cleaning out my nest, and I found an old book of my poetry




Fresh out of school 'cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
'Cause when I was in school I got the A.E.E
But there's no SC for this youngsta
I didn't have no money, so now I gotta punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonald's, "May I take your order, please?"
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
'Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes, that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and Similac?
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush?
Or Jesse Jackson, and Operation PUSH?
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill, what the hell
Crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker, little Joe, and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po'
To a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be Republican
Now I remember, I used to be cool
'Til I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
'Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than a Bush




Tell the politicians, the hustlers
Live and let live (Yeah)
Tell the politicians, the hustlers
Live and let live (Yeah)

Here's another topic I'm addressin'
So learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson
Sit your ass back and comprehend
As I let you know about man's best friend
Now remember, it used to be a dog like Lassie
But now in '91, it's a gun if you asked me
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin'
'Cause if you run up and try to play mine
I'd rather have a AK than a fucking canine
'Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetcha
Me and the dog's goin' out on a stretcher
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that
Big black gat, aim and I hit that
Forget about a dog, fool, he'll shit in the den
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend




(Dog catcher, dog catcher)
(I can dig it) Man's best friend
(Dog catcher, dog catcher)
(I can dig it)






Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack
Just in case the little punks try to jack
I can't put a motherfucking pitbull
Under a coat in the small of my back
So I gotta take my Beretta, and I betcha
It'll probably work a hundred percent better
'Cause it'll keep me out of danger
With sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
So this goes to all y'all intruders
Beware of the owner 'cause the owner is a shooter
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies
I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies
And I can't do that with Benji
Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie
Forget about a dog, fool, he'll shit in the den
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend




("Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs")
("Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit")
("The profile of a typical American gun owner is this:
Over thirty, white, male, middle class")


"Take that, motherfuckers"

Down at the best spot
It's me and J-Dee and they sellin' more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot, and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car surfaced
Oh, why did fools have to let loose?
Heard six pops from a deuce-deuce
Big Tom had to push us
Thirteen niggas runnin' straight to the bushes
For they gats so they can draw down
But why a motherfucker like me have to fall down?
Not knowin' why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt is soakin' wet
Tryna see if we got 'em
Looked down and my sweatshirt's red at the bottom
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out




Get up, man, get up, man (Come on, keep that nigga awake, man)
Come on, man, get up, man, come on, man




Woke up in the back of a trey
On my way to MLK
That's the county hospital, jack, ha
Where niggas die over a little scratch
Sittin' in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
"Yo, nurse, I'm gettin' kinda warm"
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form
Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard, "Freeze, nigga, don't move"
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Don't wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
"I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime"




Are you the only one who got shot?
What kind of a gun was he carrying? Do you know who it was?
(No, man, don't know who it was, man)
Are you in a gang?
(Man, what does it matter, man? I'm shot)




I need to see a MD
And y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree?
Look at the waiting room
It's filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin' help
Since we poor, the hospital, it moves slow
Now I'm laid out
People steppin' over me to get closer to the TV
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet?
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me in ICU
Halfway dead
No respect, and handcuffed to the bed
Now the drama starts
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
Then I begin the ass kissin'
Just to get looked at by a overworked physician
Had the chills, but my temperature's a hundred and three
Only got a Band-Aid and a IV
That's when I start cussin'
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin'






What did you get shot with? (Twenty-two)
Who shot you? (I dunno who shot me)
Was it gang-bangers? (Had to be)




Why, oh why, can't I get help?
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin'
So at 10 PM, I was Audi 5000




1234567890987654321




Let me live my life
We can no longer live our lives
Then let us give our lives for the liberation
And salvation of the Black Nation
Saints, saviors, soldiers, scholars, healers and killers
No longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our mind
Brainwashed with the white man's mind
No more homicide
No more fratricide
No more suicide, infanticide and genocide
Look the goddamn white man in his cold blue eyes
Devil don't even try, we Bebe's Kids
We don't die, we multiply
You heard the Death Side
Now open your black eyes for the rebirth, resurrection and rise




1234567890987654321




Dr. Bruce, telephone, please, Dr. Bruce, telephone, please


Come on, come on, honey, push a little harder, it's not all that bad




I see the head
Push, push




Come on




Come on, push




Come on, honey




Push


It's a boy




The black man and black woman have no further
No beginning and no ending
Before alpha and after omega
History and historians'll record
The black father and mother of morality, medicine, music and mathematics
The father and mother of all the nation of religion, philosophy, art, science and civilization
No further
All they can say about the black man
Is he was, he is, and he shall be
Before him there were none
And after him, there will be no more
Before we can make a way for the peace maker
We must kill, and get rid of the peace breaker




1111234567890987654321






The army is the only way out for a young Black teenager
We'll provide you with housing
We'll provide you with education
We'll provide you with everything you need to survive in life
We'll help you to be the best soldier in the U-S of A
Because we do more before seven a.m. 
Than most niggers do in their whole lifetime




Gainin' on ya (I'm comin')
I'm comin'
Gainin' on ya (I'm comin')
I'm comin'




I wanna kill him 'cause he tried to play me like a trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin' K and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin'
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth
Pump seventeen rounds, make his brains hang out
'Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
And that shit ain't fly
So now I'm settin' up the ultimate drive-by
And when you hear this shit, it make the world say, "Damn
I wanna kill Sam"




Do the niggas run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)
Do the niggas run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)




Mama, some man at the front door (Sit your ass down)
Uh, hi
I have reason to believe that someone in this household has just turned eighteen
Am I correct?


Here's why I wanna kill the punk
'Cause he tried to take a motherfuckin' chunk of the funk
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in
'Cause he said he was down with the LM
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, "Please don't kill my mother," so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggas who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day, Black folks can't stick together
And it's odd
Broke us down, made us pray to his God
And when I think about it, it make me say "Damn
I wanna kill Sam"




Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah (I'm comin')
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah (I'm comin')
I'm comin'




Now in ninety-one, he wanna tax me
I remember the son of a bitch used to axe me
And hang me by a rope 'til my neck snapped
Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap
And put me under dirt or concrete
But God can see through a white sheet
'Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross, well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the HIV
So I can stop makin' babies like me
And you're givin' dope to my people, chump
Just wait 'til we get over that hump
'Cause your ass is grass 'cause I'ma blast
Can't bury rap like you buried jazz
'Cause we stopped bein' whores, stop doin' floors
So, bitch, you can fight your own wars
So if you see a man in red white and blue
Gettin' chased by the Lench Mob crew
It's a man who deserves to buckle
I wanna kill Sam 'cause he ain't my motherfuckin' Uncle






We've gone nowhere in 200 years? That's correct
We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years? That's correct
We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years? That's correct




12345670987654321




You are the prince of darkness, arch enemy, father of evil
Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, vicious, wild
Tameless, barbaric, ungovernable, uncontrollable, obstinate beast




Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut
Lookin' at my girlfriend's Black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't flirt at work, you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil-ass hurt, motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
'Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace from the ebony
So when she's doing her job, you better let her be
Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus
'Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get they ass kicked
Mr. Sexual Harassment
Asking for a blow and when the answer is "fuck no"
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
'Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breasts
'Cause white bitches have no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
'Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
'Cause you raped our women and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it (Me neither)
'Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before your ass come up missin', and it's like that






I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)




Now you wanna get me
Horny little devil must be a F-A-G
Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Have me broke, eatin' Spam and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man 'cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You might have fucked the Indians, but you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top, I won't be fuckin' ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
'Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes, I start blastin'
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And won't be happy 'til I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil can't fuck me out my pay
'Cause horny little devil, true niggas ain't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me, you fuckin' homo
'Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet 'to a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can cut that Jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city, now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing, swing, swing and chop, chop, chop
Now who's the next to nut?
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up
So don't even try it, put your dick on a diet
'Cause this is Watts Riot 1991 and I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel




I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)
I'm so horny (Hey, listen to the man)




Twenty D Energizers
Twenty C Energizer?
D, not C, D
C Energizer?
D, motherfucker, D! Learn to speak English first, alright? D!
How many you say?
Twenty, motherfucker, twenty (Honey)
Mother fuck you!




1234567890987654321




Every time I wanna go get a fuckin' brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of this shit
Leave me alone! (Mother fuck you, yo, yo, check it out)
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of a nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the Black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
'Cause you can't turn the ghetto into Black Korea




Mother fuck you




1234567890987654321




Ayy
Yeah, you, motherfucker
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't shit
Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked, motherfucker
Punk-ass mark, bitch-made
Punk-ass trick in a basket
Caught up in the mix




It's the nigga you love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on?
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch?
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
'Cause I can't move to the snow
'Cause soon as y'all get some dough
You wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
"Nigga, go home" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be white or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names
You know who you are, you little punk, be true to the game


Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?
Yeah, get a little money and moved out the neighborhood and shit
But you still ain't shit




When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough, I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy, you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team?
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV, but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You're out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop sellin' out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'ma be brief, be true to the game






Yeah, motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit
But you know what? You still ain't shit
That's right, I caught you slipping
You know I could've gat you, yeah, but I didn't even trip




A message to the Oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, G
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off, genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
'Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, Oreo, and be true to the game




Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Ha-ha
And Ice Cube practices what he preaches
He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood
Be true to the game




12345678900987654321




Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin' in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin' Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
Now I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
And when the light turn green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
'Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin' they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin' out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, 'cause I'm colorblind




Killer Cali', the state where they kill
Over colors 'cause brothers don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little Locs is gettin' a little too Loc
And when it come to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong words
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a U-turn, come back and get served, nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
For men, the wrong color outfit can get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thing to me
'Cause I sling these things like a G
It's on, it's anybody killer for the summertime
I gotta get another nine even though I'm colorblind






I'm fresh out the county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
'Cause every day, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left?
The judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue-eyed
Boy, you better duck 'cause the book is comin'
So just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And this shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
'Cause believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that
But on a black and white photograph
'Cause brothers, you don't know the half
On the streets, I was damn near out of my mind
But ever since I've been down, I'm colorblind




Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby Loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke
Stable and able, but I'm not ready and willin'
'Cause I'm only thirteen and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the AK and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the five dollar stick and I put in my clip
So I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin' niggas to Harrison Ross
Caught one from the back and I looked in his eyes
Thinkin', "Should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive?"
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by the other kind
I ain't contributin' to genocide
Why?
This sucker's colorblind




Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
'Cause I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way, I get burned
Baby Boo wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together, then we color 'em dead
Dead, dying, gettin' smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral




I understand how all my homeboys feel
'Cause I've been shot and to this day I pack my steel
'Cause I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk, only the streets tell stories
Where blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you're slippin', you'll be six feet deep
See, me and T-Bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the Mob, we stay colorblind




I thought I could get into caring, but if I started caring, then I would get sloppy




1234567890987654321




O'Shea, O'Shea
Get your ass in here, boy
You hear me calling you?
O'Shea




When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
Working with the schoolhouse bully
By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G
Cheating on tests, making a mess
Cussing like a sailor at recess
It must've been a half-moon
'Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom
Chewing on Good and Plenties
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
Yo, I was living like the class clown
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes, man
When you young it's hard to see
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD
Popping out your window with a BB gun
Better yet knocking on your door and run
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank
Even though I was still shooting blanks
As soon as the dark hit
I was stealing candy out the corner market
Until I got my ass whipped
'Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit






Thirteen, that's how old I was
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
And I was looking at any butt and ass
Me and my homies started cutting class
Going up to the high school
Looking for any bitch I could lie to
Tell 'em I was older than I really was
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
That's what a mack's made of
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love
Hard as a rock the long way
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way
But I still gotta have it
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
Goddamn, I was hype
A virgin but I still knew how to lay the pipe
Even though the ho worked me
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
Then the shit got strange, money
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny
Then the nut came gushing
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing
'Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick
'Cause I was still young doing dumb shit




At seventeen got my first Volkswagen
And mastered the life-long art of dragging
To the women in college
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge
Breaking in cars and all that
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
Fucking at a real fast rate
'Til they said that I might not graduate
Then I said, "Fuck the dumb shit
'Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick
If things continue"
So I start rapping about shit I been through
And I got real good
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood
Tryna be baby macks
Doing shit that I did seven years back
Going through a stage
But before they can grow up they on the front page
And they moms is having a fit
'Cause they died young, doing dumb shit

Yo, where the fuck is that little boy at?
Stanley, bring your ass here, god damnit (Man, fuck you, punk ass nigga)
But anyway man, yo, Bone man
When I get fourteen, man, I wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold things (Stanley)
Man, fuck that shit, man
You need to take your ass to school, get you a motherfuckin' job and shit
Man, fuck that, man, fuck you, man, look here
When I get fourteen, man, I wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold with a three-wheel motion
Chin wheel pull out (Ah shit), three finger ring, fat ass link (Stanley) and a big booty go bitch to with it
Man, fuck all that
Break 'em off something
Aha, it's really sad
Young brothers and sisters today have a lack of understanding on
What it really means to be Black




Could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct? (Uh)
And the white man sittin' there tickled pink (No shit)
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous at each other's wealth (Right, right)
But comin' up's just in me
But the Black community is full of envy (Oh shit)
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood (Yup)
Build a store, and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know, us po' niggas, nappy hair and big lips? (That's right)
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out? (Shit)
We ain't nothin' but porch monkeys to the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at us


You dumb ass nigga
Break 'em off something




And all y'all dope-dealers
You're as bad as the police 'cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket (So shit)
So when can spend our money with the Blacks
Too busy buyin' gold and Cadillacs (Huh)
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did (Yup)
For 400 years, I got 400 tears, for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes (Right)
But when I do a show to kick some facts
Us Blacks don't know how to act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself, ya dumb nigga, you
Pretty soon Hip Hop won't be so nice
No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice (Man, fuck that)
And you'll sit and scream and cuss
But there's no one to blame but us






Yeah, but why is it that one motherfucker can ruin it for twenty-two thousand motherfuckers
When they wanna come see a good jam, you know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, Cube, tell 'em something, shit, you know how I feel?
Break 'em off something




Us, we'll always sing the blues
'Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
'Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga to holler out peace, black man
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs and chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice or the horses
Jobless, so I'm a ho for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
With a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us, but y'all think it's dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about




1234567890987654321




Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all




Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline






Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it




The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline




Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline




I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright
Punk, always into something, gettin' fucked at night
By Mister Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No Vaseline




Motherfuckin' nosejob havin'-ass
Motherfuckin' Jheri Curl light, Ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch

And now, the wonderous world of..
Hey, come to Los Angeles!
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles




How to survive in South Central (What you do?)
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A 9 and your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
'Cause jackers (Yo), they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're Black, they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive






Hi, this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?
Or has somebody taken your things?
Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles




Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nothin' but a trap
And females'll get you jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off Black human beings
So I think you better skip the sightseeing
And if you're nothin' but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection, mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a Section 8
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central






Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
And you'll get your ass straight smoked
Yo, I wanna say what's up to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx
Ayo Cube, these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
Goddammit!




Rule number three: don't get caught up
'Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
'Cause South Central L.A. is one big germ
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter the concrete Vietnam
You say the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die in South Central




Yeah, you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is
South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip goddammit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke, motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shoutout to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin' his two cents in
