Ooh, ooh, ooh
When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
When my story is over and my song is done
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end


All I get is motherfuckin' love in these streets
To most of these tricks I'm a motherfuckin' treat
What's beef? I ain't got no beef
See all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken
And all these chickens? They get plucked
And nobody wants to see the volcano erupt
I'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt
I'm celebrated every time I pull up
You hella hated, every time you look up
I'm elevated to rapper's deluxe
They love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind
This is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine
See, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'
It's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds
I know that you feel it, I know that you felt it
'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it




When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end


Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest
All I got is those fly ass suits and gators
Nobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters
Nobody tryin' to take my life
All these bitches tryna do is replace my wife
But you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice
Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice
Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly
Niggas might not like me but they still love me
Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle
'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle
Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop
Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible


When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end






I'm the bastard that spit the acid
Fuck a funeral home and a casket
Fuck a funeral song and a procession
Keep God on your dome and count your blessings
Keep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind
Shake 'em up and roll seven every time
Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up
Every time you see me got a different color cup
This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'
It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'
It's all about givin', about stayin' driven
It ain't about you, it's about these children
So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'
Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?
Will somebody in here hug my fam?
Don't worry about me, you know where I am


When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end

Fuckin' up at work, they never write me up
They always hold me down and raise me up
And all these women wanna glaze me up
Never turnt down, I'm turnt up

You on the grind tryna turn a dub to a G
And I'm flyin' 'round the world doin' shows overseas
I'm chillin' with some females

Too much game tryna sell some
You know you can't hate on a real one
Too $hort, I ain't no nice dude
I'm like Ice Cube, run up in your wife fool
O.G., enjoyin' my life
Still gettin' money when I'm on the mic
Thirty years later still spittin' flows
Gettin' paid to call these bitches hoes

And I'm always tryna get some more
Beeeotch

Boy, do what I say, nigga, robot

Never sold out, niggas bought out
You won't survive the fallout when I go all out
Michael ball out but never touch no balls
I ain't a athlete, I can't take no loss
All I know is champagne in my eyes
All this hate is what I don't recognize
All I know is that L-O-V-E
They beg me to drink a forty of O-E
Low key, bump like a oldie
Niggas treat me better than Kobe

Make me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust

The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive niggas off the porch (C'mon)


Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop




Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Tell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place (Let me out)
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker


Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop




Wake up, homie, hey
Them people, they coming
Listen
Wake up
Ayy, you got to get up
Ayy, them folks is at the door, man
Get up
Get up


They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak


This ain't paranoia, this is California
Best believe, motherfucker, that they coming for ya
Got the place surrounded, don't know how they found it
Man, fuck that money, ain't no time to count it
Got to get to movin', only God can save us
This is the day they try to re-enslave us
Grow my hair long, Angela Davis
So I can get recognized by the space invaders
Storm troopers, have you heard the latest?
They'll treat your living room like the Oakland Raiders
Take all your books, you ain't patriotic
You psychotic, your neighbors call you neurotic
Put you on the news and tweet about ya
These bitches won't say nothin' sweet about ya
Can I get a witness? (Now) Can't get a witness (Now)
Just brainwashing motherfuckers is a dirty business




They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak


Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up


While you on that Xbox, they closing in
You'll believe me when that front door is blowing in
They going in and they'll tackle everybody
Grandmama, grandbaby, shackle everybody
Interrupt your party, put down your drinks
Or they'll blow your nose off like the fucking Sphinx
Catch you by surprise around sunrise
When I go to sleep, I sleep with one eye
I sleep with one nine, I sleep with booby traps
And my dogs don't fuck with no Scooby snacks
I'm die-hard, I brought the movie back
Some of y'all try-hards, some of y'all don't do that
Some of y'all dumb as rocks, some of y’all sharp as a tack
Some of y'all clowns, some serious as a heart attack
I'ma fuck the police, nigga, yeah, I started that
Some of y'all scary niggas, come and be a part of that




They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak


Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up


Underwater flow, shit is getting deep
Them fuckers tried to drown the aqua boogie freak
But I'm a octopus, especially when I got to push
When shit is fishy, my trigger finger get itchy
All you sissies, I'm a general like Ulysses
Fuck with me, I'm incredible like Bill Bixby
I never sleep, cut off my eyelids
Insomniac, maniac, I'm a hybrid
Bitch, I'm a pirate, they call me Blackbeard
I sail the seven seas, ho, I'm off the grid
It's the ultimate, baby, I'm the bulk of it
The whole package, a nigga with no baggage
It's kind of tragic when you driving through Irvine
Is this Germany, 1939?
I'm a gangsta boy, not the nerdy kind
They got a dirty mind, all about the dollar sign




They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak


Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up


That's that gangsta shit
Check the original, y'all niggas digital
The pyroclastic flow, this insane


Motherfuckers love me
Young-ass niggas, they wanna thug for me
Wish I was the Godfather, sell drugs for me
But all they can do is tap, cuz for me
Look, homie, you can be my cronie
If you figure how to get a check out of Sony
(Oh Lord) Oh Lord, thought I was preaching to the choir
When I'm in this pulpit, I might catch some fire
Glass full of gas, do you got a lighter?
Hand full of ass, why should I retire?
The shit I spit might inspire the messiah
To throw these lives in a lake full of fire
Ain't nothing flier than my fuckin' rims and my tires
And a word to the wise, you better fuckin' recognize
That I been on the block since bitches did the wop
Since Floyd and Damien kept rocks in they socks, nigga
Taught 2Pac how to keep it gangsta
I showed Biggie Smalls how to release his anger
Who came before me? Melle Mel, Ice-T
King T, KRS, and the homie Chuck D
P.E., DMC, nigga, know your history
If Cube ain't top three, then you's a bitch to me
Ice Cube, the name will live in infamy
Ask the young nigga that invented Eazy-E




West Coast, bitch, yeah, that's all me
With Too $hort and the D-R-E
We made it too hard, check our family tree
See you try to make a Snapple out of all them bad apples
Nigga, no
Leave you baffled and gaffled
And running through your house like it's a motherfuckin' raffle
I'm a asshole with Tabasco, you the last ho I would ask for
If I had to leave Morehouse and walk into a ho house
The drink that I pour out, the weed that I blow out
It's all for my nigga Big Herc when I show out
Picture this in a frame, get tore out
When I wanna go out, red carpets get rolled out


There's a lot of yous (A lot), there's only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
There's a lot of yous (A lot), there's only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
Original, original, I'm the prototype
Original, original, he the copy, right
Original, original, I'm the prototype
Original, original, he the copy, right


So what, you from the gutter?
We all had to struggle if you got a Black mother
We all had to scrap with our uncles and our brothers
Bedroom window, no curtains, used covers
Motherfuckers always claim to be the hardest
But these motherfuckers never claim to be the smartest
I'm a artist that'll paint your rigor mortis
You silly rabbit, nigga, here come the tortoise
Fast is smooth and smooth is slow
And that's how you get it twenty years in a row
Advance how you get twenty years in a hole
Pretend that your ass ain't got no soul
Grab that cold-ass white man steel
Cap pills, run like an oil spill
Big drills, found him in the landfill
You got thirty years but you my man still
Fuck them tears, Tony Montana
Caught you in Montana, extradited to Atlanta
This ain't the banana, nigga, this is Alabama
Nail in your coffin when the judge rock the hammer, nigga




There's a lot of yous (A lot), there's only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
There's a lot of yous (A lot), there's only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
Original, original, I'm the prototype
Original, original, he the copy, right
Original, original, I'm the prototype
Original, original, he the copy, right


That's that gangsta shit
