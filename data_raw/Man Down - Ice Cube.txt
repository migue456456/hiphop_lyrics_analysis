I'm about to slide through, ride through
And don't give a fuck what's in my rearview
Ain't about to tell you what I been through
All I wanna know is what you into
What we gettin' into?
Yeah, we fin' to make this continue
So what's on the menu?
Got love everywhere that we went to
Gettin' chased by the aunties
She still actin' like a dime piece
She still actin' like the '90s
Didn't have to remind me
See, I used to be grimy, now I'm so polished
Didn't go to college, still got the knowlеdge
Still got the wallet to makе that deposit
Get your bitch ass back in the closet
West Coast flow like a faucet
Nigga drop game like I lost it
This ain't for you, this is boss shit
I'm on La Brea by the carpet
Dinosaur mash on the gas
Real players got to brush off the ash
Why the real ones don't last?
Why the real ones gotta pass?
Missin' you every day
Repeat all the shit that you used to say
Ran across your picture in my iPhone (iPhone)
Boy, you was wild as a cyclone (Cyclone)
Kinda like me with the mic on (Mic on)
Grab the shit tight like a python (Python)
Spit that ism, and if they really listen
You know this ism'll keep 'em out of prison
You know this ism'll keep you on a mission
Time to start livin' and stop wishin'
The sky is purple and pink
And I think that the moon gave a nigga a wink


Rollin' at twilight
Gettin' ready for the nightlife
Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)
We about to make a highlight
Rollin' at twilight (Rollin' at twilight)
Gettin' ready for the nightlife
Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)
We about to make a highlight


It's a get-together, takin' flicks together
Playin' dominoes, we can sit forever
Talkin' that shit, Jordan to Kobe
Lightin' a stogie, countin' the trophies
Friends and family, ones that can't stand me
'Cause they say I act too manly
Well, that's just me
I'ma tell it like it is, I'ma call what I see


Rollin' at twilight
Gettin' ready for the nightlife
Me and my real ones (Me and my real ones)
We about to make a highlight


Where the love go? It's a struggle
Is this happiness? Nigga, fuck no
But I'm slappin' this in your mouth, though
With a heave-ho, you a deep-throat


West Coast, bitch, it's the dosage
I can't overdose on no ho shit
Administer this pimp shit
I've been a minister since an infant
I was Kendrick before Kendrick
Rock & Roll Hall of Famer like Jimi Hendrix
So you can vomit on that bullshit
Or you can choke on your own spit when your boy's in the pulpit
Try to rob my church, I'ma rob you first
I'ma do the funeral and drive your hearse
I'ma hug your mama 'fore I steal her purse
I'ma hunt your bitch 'cause I'm the curse
Check my verse in rеverse
He spazzin' out, go gеt the nurse
She passin' out from vast amounts
Of ass to mouth, I'm cashin' out, bitch


They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)


This is cuz and happiness
So tell Al Green to pass the grits
I bag a bitch, I got a bag of tricks
Looks like you got hit with a bag of dicks
This right here is the master mix
Of Bloods and Crips, so don't resist
I'll smack your ass like Will did Chris
Give a demonstration in front of the nation
(Smack) I ain't playin'
If I had to leave your motherfuckin' ass right where you land
(Smack) Leave me alone
You might live longer if you mind your own
Watch your tone, I'm too damn grown for this shit
Sticks and stones? Well, I'ma pick the stick
And crack your ass, you need a maxi pad
To stop that blood comin' out the gash, punk


They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)


Everybody say, "Drop the attitude"
But y'all shouldn't worry 'bout what Daddy do
Y'all should worry about what kids do
I'm a cold motherfucker, get out my igloo
The CEO with a E-G-O
Can pick any flow, eenie, miney, mo
And body you bitches, make y'all religious
I'm here to fight reptiles and lizards
Motherfucker, it's the grand wizard
I take they shit, wipe my ass, then I flip it
I break they shit like when your cousins come visit
And then I tell 'em, "Fuck your analytics"
I don't pivot, I give it to you vivid
If you's a bigot, you probably won't dig it
If you's a ho, you'll probably get triggered
Like one of these internet bitches




They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)


Yeah, hey, haha (Huh, huh)
Damn, I didn't know
Damn, shit
You niggas so sensitive
Hmm, damn
Homie


Fuck your agenda
You ain't a real one, you's a pretender
See, this ain't about gender
This ain't shit but a fender bender
So why you actin' all tender?
Actin' like Karen, Sharon or Linda
Nigga, facts over feelings
Fuck your feelings, we ain't the villains
And this ain't a drill, gotta keep it real
Fuck how you feel
O'Shea ain't Boulé (Nah)
O'Shea get the Uzi (Yeah)
O'Shea off the Jose (Yay-yay)
With your bitch gettin' cozy
So stop bein' nosy
That's life, shit ain't all rosy (Yay-yay)


(Da-da-da-da)
You niggas so sensitive
But I got no fucks to give (Not one)
(Da-da-da-da)
You niggas so sensitive
Hmm, what?


They used to call these nigga words
So what the fuck are trigger words?
Words like his and hers?
What's a pronoun and a verb?
Follow this, then you follow back
Then you swallow this and swallow that (Swallowed it)
Then you go have a heart attack
And don't blame it on the vax
(Da-da-da-da) I put it on wax
Some Blacks hate when you talk about facts
But you can talk about racks
You can talk about twerkin', but not a nigga workin'
Everything ain't urban
Just like this motherfuckin' whip that I'm swervin' (Let me ride)
So here's what a ho should know
Don't be so emotional




(Da-da-da-da)
You niggas so sensitive
But I got no fucks to give (Not one)
(Da-da-da-da)
You niggas so sensitive


Say, man, don't be a pussy all your life
Be a dick sometimes and get hard (Da-da-da-da)
You niggas so sensitive
Yeah, huh (Why you so sensitive?)
Why you actin' like that, man? (Da-da-da-da)
Actin' all funny (You niggas so sensitive)
You ain't supposed to be actin' like that, man (Why you so sensitive?)
(Da-da-da-da) All in your feelings
You niggas so sensitive
Mm, but I got no fucks to give (Not one)




Yeah, I got it from the Bay
I like to make good girls do bad things (Sanctified)
And I like to take a bad girl to a ballroom banquet
Like a upscale brunch or somethin', you know? (Sanctified)
Just to see what she gon' do


Nasty or nice, put it on ice
It don't matter, what's your vice?
Take my advice, cut me a slice
Seven or eleven when you roll these dice
You can hit it once, you can hit it twice
Make your ass yell "Jesus Christ"
Middle of the day, middle of the night
It don't matter, time of your life
From a church girl to the worst girl
I like a classy chick with some nasty tricks
So lit when the ass is thick
I'm well-equipped, that's no bullshit
Well, it's apparent I'ma meet the parents
Check out my new inherence
Met her daddy in the basement
What up, pops? I'm your new replacement

She was eatin' meat in my Las Vegas suite
I like all mouth, bitch, no teeth
Had to slow her down, beep, beep, beep
No, no, no, bitch, that ain't how it go, bitch
Hit the stroll, bitch, make a nigga more rich
Suck it up only using your lips (What?)
No hands, get your pants
Time to go, I got some plans
Kiss goodbye? Not a chance
Wanna come back, bring a lot of friends
I can sit back and watch 'em all dance
Then pick a couple out and take 'em to the back
Smoke a little weed with 'em, we can make it crack
At first, she wasn't with it
And then we did it, and we did it, and we did it, and we did it


Oh, some girls do, some girls don't (Ooh)
Some girls will, some girls won't (Oh my, my, sanctified, oh, sanctified, yeah)

Her breasts sit up and they perky, make like a baby, she nurse me
I'm tipsy, I'm swervy, I got a woody, I'm right

(No, no, no, no)
Some say yes, some say no
Some say stop, some say go (Oh no, no, girl, sanctified)


She's a bigger player than me
Everywhere we go and everywhere we be, it's no rules (No rules)
But when we all alone, we some fools
Fuck her in her dress and her shoes (And her shoes)
Didn't make it past the living room
We fuckin' on the floor, that's what we doin' (That's what we doin')
We never made it to the bed (To the bed)
'Cause all the way home, she was givin' me head

Four of the best to ever do it, the best
Mount Westmore, say it again




First thing I think about is your tussling smile
And all the things that drive me wild


Peep this, it's not a secret (No)

Young fool, he call me old school (Damn)
But you the one hope to reach twenty-two (So true)
Young boo, I done lived two of you (Two of you)
Young dog, I done lived three of y'all
So listen to a nigga when I’m freein' y'all (Listen)
It's no sucker shit when it's me involved (None, ayy, crazy)


Understand I am not like them
Chew 'еm up, spit 'em out like phlegm (Crazy, mm)
And I am so convincеd (What?)
This world, it don't make sense


Back to the future, it’s a crisis
Controlled by these hand devices
Smartphone (Smartphone) equal dumb domes (Dumb domes)
Done forgot how to make my way back home
Ain’t that a bitch?
Which way we goin', huh? (Ayy, do you remember my phone?)
I forgot, shit
We fish, call internet (Damn)
So let’s blow up the internet (Boom)
It's artificial intelligence (Fake shit)
That make people irrelevant
Niggas goin' where the devil went
But Cube, never out my element
Keep it one thou'-thou’ (Yeah)
And if you wanna bring the funk
Niggas still down with the pow-pow
If I do it, I'll never regret it (Never)
This world'll drive you crazy if you let it (Fuck that)


(Never) And I am so convinced (What?)
This world, it don't make sense (Yeah)
Understand I am not like them (No)
I'd rather be here kickin' with Kim


Every time I see them cakes
A nigga can't concentrate, that's why I'm overweight
'Cause I overate, wanna procreate
Let's glide on this beat like roller skates, baby (Yeah)
Understand I am not like them
My cup runneth over past the rim
Check out my melody like Rakim
It's not a felony chasin' my celery
Fuck what you tellin' me, I'ma live heavenly (Yeah)
Do this shit 'til I'm seventy
Do this shit 'til I'm ninety
And I still got the homie
Mr. WC as my crimee
You in the foxhole with the vets (That's right)
Livin' life with no regrets (Yeah)

Look, ho, are you crazy or just lazy?
I know the hair and nails are fugazi
Look at Tracy, walkin’ in them Daisy Dukes
Like a prostitute, a nigga had to shoot
'Cause I hit them boots, I'm not your lover (No)
Never judge a book by the motherfuckin' cover
You can call your mother and your crackhead brother
I'm still not your man, dumb bitch, did I stutter? (D-D-Dumb bitch)
Crazy ass, throw your shit in the gutter
Psycho bitch, punch a hole in the rubber (Damn)
Psycho, heifer, disco, bitch
Go to the kitchen, hit your ass with the hot Crisco
I went down and I bought mе a whistle
And a pistol just for this sick ho (Crazy bitch)

When I go get a meal, see you parked up the hill (That's her)
Always tryna push us, hidin' in the bushes (Woo, we in the hood, bitch)
My paint scratched, car on the flat
That’s how you wanna act, you fucking maniac? (Get back)
Go get a life, bitch, I got me a wife
I got me a motherfuckin’ gun and a knife
I know you slow, ho, didn't even graduate
’Cause your ass too busy bumpin' Jazze Pha
Fuck the ass, homies see how the bitch act
Is she one can short of a six-pack?
When she call the police, kick you off the lease
And not let you see your lil' baby for a week
Ain't just a freak, she a motherfuckin’ freak
And tell her ass to get my name on the cheek (Crazy ho)
Ho, you crazy as a Vietnam veteran
Go get your pills, bitch, better take your medicine (Cuckoo)

You's a ditzo, schizomanic depressant
I have a nigga sittin' home panickin', stressin'
She ain't bipolar, this bitch buy weed
She ain't that sober, she off that Twea
Half cocked and not playin' with a full deck
No need to rubberneck, the bitch is a train wreck
She ain't the one, homie, don't even try
Unless you want your dick superglued to your thigh
You'll have to be restrained, held and detained
The first time the ho call your mama out her name
A one-night stand will lead to weddin' plans
And talk about soccer practice and minivans
Fuck with that and you's a fool
I know that ass is fat, but nigga, I'm cool
I'm havin' flashbacks of that day in school
When she slit her wrists and jumped into the pool, nigga


I think this ho is psychotic (5150, the bitch need an antibiotic)
I think this ho is psychotic (5150, the bitch need an antibiotic)

You wanna act like a man? I'ma treat you like a man
Bitch, get in the car
Lookin' like an overfed St. Bernard
Or a curlin' iron burn on your forehead
Your stomach look like a baked potato

Respect you 'fore he select you
This truth will affect you
Nobody wanna be the next you
Everybody want my job
Nobody want your job 'cause your job's a blowjob
Funny man on stage with the mic
Try to laugh when he talk about your life, no cap

These three little piggies say I ain't good as Biggie
These motherfuckin' niggies say my pen game is iffy
This ain't just yellin', nigga, this is storytellin'
Are there any seeds up in that watermelon?
Just because the melanin, never sold the heroin
Still got the avalanche flow that will bury them
Still got the pyroclastic flow and the calico
Red nigga, pale face, treat me like a Navajo
Bag a ho like a nigga work up at Stop-N-Go
Mop your ass then do a show, I call it mop and glow
Got to get my capital, Ice Cube is tactical
Holy mackеrel, don't have to mack a ho
All I got to do is ask a ho (Ask a ho)
Then it's all mathеmatical, some say I'm radical
Skip the sabbatical, do you wanna battle, though?
Bitch niggas already know how that'll go
Fuckin' with Geronimo, even playin' dominoes
Get ghost, adiós, nigga, vámonos
Motherfucker, I'm the Coast, get my locs
Get my folks takin' tokes, you's a hoax
Do you have any hits or just features?
These creatures spit bullshit from the bleachers
I'm the grim reaper with the ether
I'm the one that hit you with a sleeper, left you lookin' like a tweaker
Can you make it come out the speakers?
With over thirty years of heaters, motherfuckers can't beat us
Y'all better join us, anoint us
Yup, kick back and take pointers and stop cuttin' corners
Don't you try to warn us 'cause these lyrics are enormous (Yeah)
And I'm the truth and y'all just performance
He said, "Cube still got it," that's when I shot his ass
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout, bitch? I'm the product (Blast)
I'll never lose it, nigga, I'll just abuse it
Are we talkin' movies, bitch, or are we talkin' music?




Just sit down, let me tell you a story
About a young man tryna find his glory (Oh no, no)
He did everything you can do in the streets to get his bag (Oh, yeah)
But if you never stop for love, life can be a slow drag (Mm)
What a drag, what a drag


More money, more problems (Problems)
Ever since we got this money, we continue squabblin'
I remember (I remember) we used to be steady mobbin'
Everybody wanna be Batman, fuck Robin (Fuck Robin)
Now when them thangs get to poppin' (Poppin')
Choppers get to choppin', loved ones get to droppin' (Get to droppin')
When them hearts get to stoppin'
Nobody cares about all the money that you clockin'
A bully on that bullshit (Bullshit), got a bullseye (Bullseye)
I forgot he said he on demon time (Mm)
I'm on God's time (Yeah), this is oil and water
Your ass is with the devil, I'm with the Holy Father (Mm)
You'll probably shoot your mama (Mama)
For an extra comma over marijuana (A piranha)
Everybody say they want the bag
Yeah, I wanna get it, but not that bad


Let me tell ya this ghetto story
About a boy tryna find his glory, glory, glory
He did everything you can do in these streets to get a bag (Everything, oh yeah)
But if you don't stop for love, life can be a slow drag, slow drag




I'm tryna get cropped up without gettin' locked up
I'm tryna lay in the cut without gettin' mopped up
I'm tryna stand on my own and never get propped up (Never)
The pyroclastic flow can't get stopped up (No)
Niggas love money (Money), money love me (Me)
Please don't make me have to do you ugly
I'm tryin' not to be like a fuckin' thug be
Look at the sky, this fuckin' day is lovely
I'm tryin' not to hate ya for this little caper
Why you motherfuckers tryna pull me out my nature?
When you a Laker, everybody hates ya
Bitch niggas on the internet always tryna bait ya
And if you take the bait (Bait), they'll try to regulate
I'll bust on they ass like Warren G and Nate (Regulate)
And if you slip, they'll do you like they did Nip
Niggas from your own hoods send you on a trip


Let me tell you people my ghetto story
All about a man tryna find his road (Damn, his road, his road)
He did it all (He did it all) in these streets just to get his bag (Yeah, fuck)
But if you never stop for love, life is such a slow drag


Oh no, I can't trust 'em no more
We used to roll six-fours, I can't trust 'em no more (Oh no)
Oh no, I can't trust 'em no more

After doin' more than a dub

I'm really mobbin', I'm a mobber, I'll mob on you (Mob, facts)
I'm really mobbin', I'm a mobber, I'll mob on you (Mob, mob)


I used to roll with Da Lench Mob
Doin' hip-hop 'til the shit pop
My nigga J-Dee, he had to break rocks
'Cause in the streets is where they lay opps
On the other side of the planеt
Got the phone call, homie's in a panic
Goddamn it, what happеned?
Niggas started fightin', then niggas started cappin'
I went to court out in Torrance
Had to make sure I didn't have warrants (Stay down)
No snitchin' to say the least

Think twice 'fore you go beast mode
Nigga kill a demon in a hurry (In a hurry)
You the GOAT, I make curry
Bitch, Steph Curry will bury (Will bury)
Them threes like Tom, Dick, and Harry
Leave them colonizers in the cemetery now


They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah, my ego's the cheat code)


Yo
And as a young wild nigga that was moving and that was lit out
A young Busta that was buggin', tryna figure shit out
Got my name from Chuck D and I was hype like, "What's the drilly?"
Then came the birth of Leaders of the New, fucking up Spectrum City
Yeah, and I remember to this day
Cube and N.W.A. was beefin', the group was in a disarray
Stayed at the stu' on school nights late, lookin' forward to a spankin'
Couldn't believe who pulled up to 510 South Franklin
P.E. headquarters, thinking 'bout Turks and Caicos
Chuck and Hank pulled up with Cube
While a nigga lookin' like Thanos
They know what was about to happen like they had Dracos
In their hip line curating and strategizing AmeriKKKa's
Most Wanted and he haunted MCs and walked with machetes
I never seen this act of hunger from rappers platinum already
Thank you, Cube, I got my foot up on the clutch
While shifting the gear, I learned how to win while not giving a fuck, nigga
