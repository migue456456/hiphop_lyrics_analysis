Rush they ass to the dirt, we about to move the earth
Megahertz do the work, this a code blue alert
Homegirl do the twerk, BBL ’bout to burst
When it burst, it's the worst
You was in it face first
Get your mind out the gutter
Homie, it's about the butter
It’s about the milk and honey, get your mouth off the other
It's about your baby brother, get him out this motherfucker
Put him on the right path, teach him how to fight back
Teach him how to whoop some ass
Teach him how to mega-blast
Teach him how to get the money, and make the cheddar last

West coast warlord, never stay silent
Tryna stay dignified
They want you sissy-fied
Doing the electric slide
Nigga, that's suicide
Who riding? I'm your worldwide tour guide
This ain't glorified
I leave the motherfuckers horrified
Hit a bull in the bull's eye
With the .45
Live my life, do or die
It's not a X chromosome, girl, it’s a Y
I got the power to stand like a tower
They got the nerve to run like some cowards

Crying all day 'til his mouth hurt, fool
Lying all day, what he 'bout to do
Turn into a motherfuckin' tiger, all out the blue

They tricked him, robbed him, slapped him and kicked him
You can catch him in the kitchen
Bitchin' 'bout what he gon' do, but it's all fiction
Lyin' to me, won't bust a grape in a winery

Some of y'all suffer in silence
Some of y'all look through your eyelids
Some of y'all tolerate tyrants
Some of y'all woke up and chose violence
Say less, some wanna protest
Some wanna picket, others like to unrest
Say it with your chest, but can you bring it like the funk fest?
Can y'all pass the punk test?
Enough of this talkin', when we gon' get it?
I hold a grudge, I must admit it
You a ostrich, move like a hostage
Sit there and let them beat your ass out your profits

Create a clone through this iPhone
It's the perfect device to get spied on
Swipe up, swipe down, pipe down
Type it in, never, ever write it down
Knowing, it's mind controlling
First you start scrolling, then you start trolling
Yeah, what you know about a prison?
Ain't no rhythm in this algorithm, no
It's about the vision
It's about to be a head on collision
Lost my religion
Motherfuckers gotta Google where God at
I despise that
He under my hat

You'd rather ask a nerd like Zuckerberg
Go ahead homie, go and join the herd
You's a blue light zombie (Zombie)
Become an unhealthy, selfish as a selfie
Go ahead, ask Open AI
When you know that they lie about the fourth of July
Information artificial, blow the whistle
You know that we with you, go get the pistol
Shoot the fat screen first then the laptop
Kill your iPhone then smoke your Xbox
And when they call SWAT, here come the robots
Don't matter if the motherfuckin' door's locked
They shooting in the dark, ripping us apart
Motherfuckers only mad 'cause we too smart






They hit us with the freedom
It don't cost you a penny to be dumb
They hit us with the freedom
What's the reason? That shit is treason


I think the most important thing to understand about AI is that AI is not a tool
It is an agent

Called me outdated
Then he threw a sucker punch
Nigga, I ate it

And it tasted kind of like Captain Crunch
Then I heard they had to smoke him like a pack of blunts
I don't know, I'm somewhere in some swimming trunks
Been out the country for many, many, many months
My alibi is like a lullaby
Got niggas thinking that I’m soft as a butterfly
Bitch, I talk softly with a big stick
Crazy like Bushwick

Money for the pulpit

That incarceration at an early age
And my pops taught me that your pops should have probably taught you, young fella
Stop playing with grown men
You pretending to be tough, they pretending to be square
And just being ignorant and young don't make you invincible
Somebody will murder you out here




Yup, yup, California dreamin' (California dreamin')
Yup, yup

Why every time you're California dreamin'
Herе come a motherfucker always schеmin'?
Yeah, him and his demons, always with his team and always triple teamin'
You just out with your woman, trying to have a good time, didn't see it comin'
They want somethin' for nothin', California dreamin' lead to California bustin'
Never mind, let's have a good time
Sun shined up to one time
Grapevine, drink some great wine
Take weed across the state line
Patrice Rushen on the baseline
Way back before FaceTime
It feels like '89
You still like the way we grind, huh


Yup, yup
Yup, yup
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
Yup, yup
Yup, yup, California dreamin' (California dreamin')


I don't need no genie
All I need is her in a string bikini
And I got my wishes
Sorry that I'm not that superstitious
I'm not over-religious
But I spit the gospel with the quickness
Can I get a witness?
Nowadays we got a lot of snitches




All I'm doin' is dreamin'
All these diamonds doin' is gleamin'
All I'm doin' is dreamin'
All these diamonds doin' is gleamin'
All I'm doin' is dreamin'
All these diamonds doin' is gleamin'
All I'm doin' is dreamin'

Or we can get into some gangsta shit (I love it)

'Cause they like that grown man status (I love it)
We don't do no chasing
Young bucks be chasing like Jason
Always smell good
He always smell like the hood
See, I'm a true provider
He's an appetizer, get thе apple cider
Sit him at the kiddiе table
'Cause grown folk business could be fatal
Hand him the Play-Doh
'Cause you want a nigga that's nice and stable
You only exercise semen
My love will exorcise demons
Make your head spin around
Poltergeist will escape when the bed levitate, come on








She told the young fella (I love it)
Hand me that salt and pepper
Nobody do it better than that salt and pepper
She told the young heifer (I love it)
Give me that salt and pepper

We about to show up deep
Don't sleep everybody, 'cause the climb is steep
I need all my peeps, I need all my fools, I need all my freaks
Deep as a hood meetin'
What you know about good eatin'?
Everybody comin', nobody leavin'
Open up the back door
Got a gang of motherfuckers fillin' up the back row
It's about to get rowdy
It's about to get cloudy
Bitch, don't crowd me
I'm comin' with a gang of folks
With all my peeps and all my locs
We want all the smoke
We want all the fire, whatever your desire
Got the entire empire
Everybody on the block, everybody at thе spot
And the suckers throw up when wе show up
Arrogant as fuck with our nose up
You wonder who the fuck we are
And that question is so bizarre
We the ones who can buy the bar
See, I'm the star with the big cigar
They don't have to park my car
I leave it right here and it won't go far
Standin' in line is asinine
Motherfuckers won't touch me like a porcupine
They know who the fuck I'm with
And when that chick ask me who to get






Bring everybody
I mean everybody
I want everybody

(Who you with?) You know us, come on




Showed up with an army
Move, excuse me, pardon me
Nobody wanna stunt easily
Made our way to the front
Smokin' that funkadelic
People lookin' 'round, pretend they don't smell it
And when she saw me inhale it
She gave me the thumbs up, I knew she wouldn't tell it
Please don't kick us out
Until all the liquor's out
I brought all my niggas out
We tryin' to get her to stick it out (Haha)
Having fun with my day ones (Day ones)
So don't catch a stray one (Stray one)
Punk, you better play dumb
If they fuck around and ask you where you from
I'm from the land of the scandalous
The evangelist from Los Angeles
I keep the candle lit
But that's not a candle, that's cannabis
Got more homies outside
Finally arrived, it's about time
Your boy better let 'em in
These are veterans, they ain't checkin' in
From dust to dust, kickin' up dust, it is a must
And if you're ever in a fight, then you're beatin' one of us
Break out before you get bum-rushed






We got everybody
I mean everybody
I want everybody
I said everybody (Who you with?)
Bring everybody (Who you with?)
I want everybody (Who you with?)

Everybody (Who you with?), come-come, come on

I put the G in the ghetto
Boy in the hood like Ren, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Cube and Yella (Hello)
There he go, lil' nigga, big ego
'Cause I'll slap a motherfucker like Deebo (Smack)
And you about to be a witness to this shit
'Cause I'm about to give the business to this bitch
Now where the nigga go? (Where that nigga go?)
Is it typical for one man to be that egotistical?
I'm in the dark room, bangin' on the ivory
Hittin' all the wrong keys, listenin' to my diary
I love Cube for introducin' me to G raps
That was way before we did the song with G Rap
Mr. Scarface is back
You niggas need to start facin' facts 'cause y'all wastin' tracks
You only get a minute to pray and a second to flee
Your number-one rapper second to me
What you expect him to be?




They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)




They'll call you arrogant, they'll call you cocky too
Come back and beat they ass just like Rocky II
I'm your hero, he's a young weirdo
I've been here over thirty-five years, though
Little bastards always try to put the master out to pasture
That's a disaster
Young guns, they think they much faster
I'm the blaster, turn you into Casper, fool
Turn you into plaster, fool
Be hard as concrete in your casket, fool
I know the protocol, pride come before the fall
But your confidence, it need a overhaul
You kinda timid, me? I'm self-centered
You 'bout as loud and rowdy as Kawhi Leonard
Me and Scarface push it to the limit
Yep, we represent it, bitch, 'til you steppin' in it
We the shit






They know (Don't forget)
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)




Pack your bags, bitch, we goin' on a ego trip (Uh-huh)
To a place that I visit often, three, four sips (Three)
Head bigger than a mascot, mean ol' limp
Pull your card like a dealer on the Reno Strip
At the blackjack table, makin' C-notes flip (Uh-huh)
Pullin' cheese out the bag like Doritos chips (Yes)
Off a pill, on my Neo shit
Fled the bill on a Filipino bitch off of Leo's list
Cube might've had a bad influence (Yay-yay)
I was at the school dance tellin' girls "Put your ass into it" (Haha)
The teacher like, "Matt, quit harassin' students"
So I slapped him and told him, "Rap made me do it"
Face know how I rock, we don't talk to police
Peace to my dogs that I lost to the streets
Might remix the "CARNIVAL" beat
My ego gon' be bigger than Ye's when this song get released
I swear, haha




They know
It's my ego
All you hoes (All you hoes), you know (You know how it go)
It's my ego (Yeah)

Black isn't power, knowledge is power
For you can be black as a crow
You can be white as snow
And if you don't know and ain't got no dough, you can't go
And that's for sho'
This one's for the OGs that feel like I feel, yeah




I'm clean as they come (Clean as they come), mean with the gun (Mean with the gun)
Me and my team, we gleam with the sun
In a beam with the young, rhyme on the drum
Let me show you how to make cream out of crumb
Get it out the mud, sweat, tears, and blood
When you shoot your shot, make sure it ain't a dud
Don't shoot a slug inside a thug
That'll gеt your ass stretched out like a rug
Thеy finna pull the plug, don't call his phone
Homie, what you doing, boy? Don't you see that drone?
Don't you see them cameras posted all around your home?
Tyrone ain't a clone, what the fuck that nigga on?
Twilight Zone, home with the highlights on
I micromanage this motherfuckin' microphone
West Coast, nigga, is what I condone
They call me Black, but I'm really, really Capitone
Don't give a fuck what the cops is on
I'm getting blown, bitch, with my boxers on
Before she started, my socks was on
She blew 'em off when she turned the rocket on, nigga






All work and no play, come and get this work
I don't play with these motherfuckin' megahertz
All work and no play, come and get this work

A nigga ain't playin' when I'm giving you this work
Get it out the mud, pull it out the dirt
A nigga ain't playin' when I'm giving you this work




24/7 (Yeah), 365, fuck a day off, every night is the playoffs
I work smarter and harder
I heard a nigga say "What?"
Make money, drink water, and I'm doing that (Yeah)
Always pursuing that
Dog really move the cat (Woof), you can't ruin that
Vacations don't tempt me
'Cause I'm living up in your fuckin' mind, bitch, rent free
And it's empty, full of cobwebs
Now I see why your motherfuckin' eyes red
I work a double shift, plus OT
Then I smoke an O-Z where the hoes be
I'm the youngest son of hozie
You know the game, pimp (Yup)
Yo' bitch chose me
But I don't want her (Nah), you can have her back
You's a sperm donor that turned on her
I'm a earner with the burner (Wow)
Nat Turner will make you a great learner
The back burner is where you cook (Yeah)
Most of y'all will never know what it took






All work and no play, come and get this work
I don't play with these motherfuckin' megahertz
All work and no play, come and get this work
